# Community Code of Conduct

## Introduction

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all contributors, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, ethnicity, religion, age, or similar personal characteristics.

This code of conduct outlines our expectations for participant behavior as well as the consequences for unacceptable behavior.

## Expected Behavior

The following behaviors are expected and requested of all community members:

- Participate in an authentic and active way.
- Exercise consideration and respect in your speech and actions.
- Attempt collaboration before conflict.
- Refrain from demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
- Be mindful of your surroundings and of your fellow participants.

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are considered harassment and are unacceptable within our community:

- Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or otherwise discriminatory jokes and language.
- Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
- Personal insults, particularly those related to gender, sexual orientation, race, religion, or disability.
- Inappropriate photography or recording.
- Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching, groping, and unwelcome sexual advances.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you are subject to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please notify a community organizer as soon as possible.

Additionally, community organizers are available to help community members engage with local law enforcement or to otherwise help those experiencing unacceptable behavior feel safe.

## Enforcement

- Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
- If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all community spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other community members or the general public.
